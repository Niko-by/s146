    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our AI-based psychology app, developed by S146 based on OpenAI and other AI models. We are committed
        to
        protecting
        your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled responsibly and transparently. This privacy policy
        outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We collect your email address when you sign up via Apple or Google
            account to create a profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> You can choose to record audio in the app. These recordings are sent to
            our AI model for analysis and response generation. The audio is not stored or saved anywhere after
            processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Crash Data:</strong> We use Firebase analytics and crash reporting to collect
            anonymous data for analyzing app usage and improving the app's performance. This data is not personally
            identifiable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your email address is used solely for account creation and authentication. We do not use your email for marketing
        or share it with third parties.</p>
    <p>Audio recordings are used only for the purpose of generating responses based on your input. These recordings are
        processed by the AI model and are not stored or retained after the session ends.</p>
    <p>Analytics and crash data are used to monitor app performance, identify errors, and improve user experience. This
        data is collected in an anonymized form and does not identify individual users.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services like Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. These services may collect
        information that helps us improve our app. Firebaseâ€™s privacy policy can be found here: <a
            href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy"
            target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to delete your account and all associated data. If you wish to delete your data, you can do so
        directly within the app through the menu option for account deletion. Once deleted, your data will be
        permanently erased.</p>

    <h2>Age Restrictions</h2>
    <p>Our app does not have any specific age restrictions. However, we recommend that minors seek parental guidance
        before using the app.</p>
